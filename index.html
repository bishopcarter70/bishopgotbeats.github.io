		<p> BishopGotBeats also known as Dayan Jean, Dayanmakebeats is a Haitian-American music producer that was born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti <br>
		on January 30, 2001. At the age of 9, Bishop moved to Flatbush, Brooklyn NY to live with his father. <br> That was when, Bishop started experimenting with MixCraft, Fl Studio & would spent the remaining of his childhood. 
		While attending Walt Whitman Middle School, Bishop started making beats where he was inspired by Speaker Knockerz, Chief Keef, Young Chop & Future. <br>
		Once he got to high school, Bishop kept improving his craft by developing his Photoshop skills, mixing and audio engineering. 
		In 2016, Bishop sold a beat to G3Chris also known as MixbyEl and that led to his first song called Want From Me. </p>
